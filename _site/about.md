We work on lots of science in the Webb lab.  Some of the things we particularly science are:

* What do trait-based approaches tell us about community and ecosystem level response to environmental change?
* What mechanisms affect the dynamics of disease prevalence in highly virulent diseases?
* How does the spatial distribution of organisms impact their response to disturbances?
