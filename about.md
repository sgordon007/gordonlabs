We work on lots of science in the Webb lab.  Some of the things we particularly science are:

* What do trait-based approaches tell us about community and ecosystem level response to environmental change?
* What mechanisms impact persistence and dynamics of diseases in their wildlife reservoirs?
* Bringing ecology to understanding livestock epidemiology and control.
* General quantitative ecology and evolution.
